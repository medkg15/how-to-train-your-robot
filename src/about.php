        <h2>The Team Goals</h2>

        <p>The goal of this project is to accomplish the following:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Motivate children between 8 to 10 years old to learn the fundamental concepts of computing
                programming such as program, automation, testing, loops, and decision making (if/then) through creating
                a
                game application.
            </li>
            <li>Understand the fundamental concepts that are needed for teaching a student to understand
                programming.
            </li>
            <li>Evaluate what tools and technologies are currently available for children to learn the basics of
                programming.
            </li>
            <li>Leverage what has already been done in this field and develop a game-based application that will
                teach students (in particular elementary school students) the basics of programming.
            </li>
            <li>Pilot this game-based application to a group of children and observe and record their responsiveness
                to the application. Additionally, examine whether or not participants show evidence of understanding
                specific programming concepts (automation, repetition, sub-routines, etc.)
            </li>
        </ol>
